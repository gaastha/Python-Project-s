# Python-Project-s
This repo have all the project which I have implemented in Python .

Project 1: - Acronyms Using Python

An acronym is a short form of a word created by long words or phrases such as NLP for natural language processing.
To create acronyms using Python, you need to write a python program that generates a short form of a word from a given sentence. 
You can do this by splitting and indexing to get the first word and then combine it. I am first taking a string user input, 
then I am using the split() function in Python for splitting the sentence. Then I declared a new variable ‘a’ to store the acronym of a phrase.
Then at the end, I am running a for loop over the variable ‘text’ which represents the split of user input. 
While running the for loop we are storing the index value of str[0] of every word after a split and turning it 
into an uppercase format by using the upper() function.


Project 2:-- Generate Random password using random module

I first imported the random module in python ,then I asked for user input for the length of the password.Then I stored the letters,numbers and special 
characters that I want to be considered while generating a password.Then I am doing a random sampling by joining the length of the password and the variable s, 
which will finally generate a random password.
